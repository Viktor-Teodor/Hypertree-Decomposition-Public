# Hypertree-Decomposition-Public
The first public code for finding the Hypertree Decomposition and Fractional Hypertree Decomposition of a query in polynomial time.

The report, titled Hypertree Decomposition, walks with the reader along key notions in the fields of graph and databases theory. The Hypertree Decomposition algorithm is based 
on the high level pseudocode described in the white paper titled "Hypertree Decompositions and Tractable Queries" by Georg Gottlob, Nicola Leone, Francesco Scarcello.

The Fractional Hypertree Decomposition implemantation is based on the high-level pseudocode described in "General and Fractional Hypertree Decompositions: Hard and Easy Cases" 
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01090.pdf).
